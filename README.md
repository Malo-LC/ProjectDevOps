# ProjectDevOps

Subject : The client is Agile Auto Parts (AAP), a major worldwide auto parts retailer. Its business has 
grown steadily for over 20 years. But since 2005 a decline in revenues has forced the CED to 
investigate and take actions to restore growth.
The board has clearly identified the IT department and services as the #1 suspect.
Several members of the board have heard about how DevOps has helped their rivals radically 
increase their Time to Market (TTM).
Thus they are open to adopt DevOps but would like specific input from you in order to be able 
to weigh the pros and cons.


In our report you'll find : 
-Blueprint of the existing solution
-Blueprint of our solution
-The response to the main concerts 
-And some screenshots of our Proof of Concept. 

And you can find our code in this repo.
